> This file contains Feedforward neural network with two hidden layers.
- #### [Train.py](https://github.com/sanket5792/BE-IT-Project/blob/main/Project/train.py)
> In this file we trained our dataset by using techniques like Tokenization, Stemming, Bag of words and train NeuralNetwork.
- #### [nltk_utils](https://github.com/sanket5792/BE-IT-Project/blob/main/Project/nltk_utils.py)
> In this file we import a toolkit name nltk.utils for great pre trained models and corpus of data which makes text processing and analysis pretty quick and easy.We use Porter Stemmer.
