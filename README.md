data.py
train.py
```
- #### [Intents.py](https://github.com/sanket5792/BE-IT-Project/blob/main/Project/intents.json)
>  This is the dataset file which contains symptoms and medicine of diseases.
- #### [Model.py](https://github.com/sanket5792/BE-IT-Project/blob/main/Project/model.py)
> This file contains Feedforward neural network algorithm.
- #### [Train.py](https://github.com/sanket5792/BE-IT-Project/blob/main/Project/train.py)
> In this file we applied Tokenization, Stemming, Bag of words on our dataset and trained that data using NeuralNetwork.
- #### [Nltk_utils](https://github.com/sanket5792/BE-IT-Project/blob/main/Project/nltk_utils.py)
> In this file we import a toolkit name nltk.utils for great pre trained models and corpus of data which makes text processing and analysis pretty quick and easy. The algorithm that we used are Porter Stemmer, Tokenization, Bag of words.
- #### [App.py](https://github.com/sanket5792/BE-IT-Project/blob/main/Project/app.py)
> In this file we use a GUI library name Tkinter. Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

### 5.[Required Library]
- `tenserflow` TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
- `keras` Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.
- `Pytorch`PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR).
- `NLTK`NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite that contains libraries and programs for statistical language processing. It is one of the most powerful NLP libraries, which contains packages to make machines understand human language and reply to it with an appropriate response.
- `Tkinter`Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Import the Tkinter module.
